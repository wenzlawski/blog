This is the first post in my Quarto blog. Welcome!

Quick rationale for using **Quarto** as a solution for blogging.
Since there are so many high quality solutions to writing a web blog, I think it good to give a quick explanation of why Quarto is so amazing for scientificy and technical blogging!

First of all, the ease of use of Quarto is simply unbeatable.
Designed with scientific writing in mind, it seamlessly integrates with and renders everything from markdown files (including inline code), Jupyter Notebooks, etc to beautiful HTML pages.
